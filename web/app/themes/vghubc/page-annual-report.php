                  <div class="col-half">
                    <p class="small">Slated for completion in the fall of 2017, the
                    Centre will open the doors to a new era of
                    mental health care. With $57 million from the
                    provincial government and over $27 million
                    coming from donors (including a lead gift of
                    $12 million from the Segals) it is a beautiful
                    example of how philanthropy can drive
                    change right here in Vancouver. I feel blessed
                    to be reminded of that each morning.</p>
                    <p class="small">As President and CEO of BC’s leading adult
                    health care foundation, it is a dream come
                    true to be in the position of matching donors’
                    philanthropic desires with transformational
                    projects that will benefit all British Columbians.
                    It is a responsibility I am both honoured and
                    humbled to fulfil.</p>
                    <p class="small">Our Foundation is Vancouver Coastal Health’s
                      (VCH’s) primary philanthropic partner in
                      Vancouver. We raise funds for specialized
                      adult health care and research for all British
                      Columbians at Vancouver General Hospital
                      (VGH), UBC Hospital, GF Strong Rehab Centre
                      and VCH Research Institute, as well as for
                      community health services for families across
                      Vancouver through Vancouver Community
                      Health Services.</p>
                    <p class="small">While government funds essential services,
                    many game-changing projects, such as
                    new programs and facilities, leading-edge
                    research and advanced, more efficient
                    medical equipment can only be realized with
                    donors as key partners. Quite simply, we act
                    as a vital link to provide the people, places,
                    programs and tools our health care teams
                    need to deliver the best patient care possible.
                    And thanks to donors like you, we have had
                    an extraordinary year.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="col-half">
                    <p class="small">In this Annual Report, you will read some
                    amazing stories about six areas of where
                    philanthropy is playing a major role delivering
                    innovative, transformative and sustainable
                    health care. Thanks to donors like you, we
                    are building new operating rooms including
                    a Hybrid Operating Room at VGH, the first
                    phase in an ambitious plan to reimagine
                    surgical care at VGH and UBC Hospital.</p>

                    <p class="small">This plan will not only significantly
                    improve the effectiveness and efficiency
                    of specialized surgical services, it will also
                    allow VCH to attract (and keep) top surgical
                    talent. Also thanks to you, our world-class
                    cardiology services will be enhanced with an
                    electrophysiology (EP) lab that will enable
                    VGH’s heart specialists to increase capacity
                    and provide leading-edge treatment.</p>
                    <p class="small">Transforming health care takes an
                    innovative vision and passionate people to
                    make it happen. On behalf of the hundreds
                    of thousands of British Columbians who
                    benefit from your generosity – please accept
                    our heartfelt gratitude and know that you
                    are playing a vital role in the future of health
                    care in BC.</p>
